# Code Tours
This repository contains didactic code organized by concepts. In lieu of embedded comments, _code tours_ are utilized as a method of guilding the learner through the material. In order to use these tours:
- clone this repository
- cd into one of the directories (e.g. `cd js` or `cd react`)
- open the directory in vscode by running `code .` on the command line
You will need to make sure that you have the [CodeTour](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/educators/codetour) extension

## Keeping up to date with this repo
When a new change is pushed, run `git pull` to get the changes. It is recommended to not make changes to the master branch in order to prevent conflicts when pulling. If you wish to make notes, make a new branch using `git checkout -b nameOfYourBranch`. Then when you want to get the most recent changes, run `git switch master` to get back to the main branch, then `git pull` to update master. At this point, you can either merge your changes to master by running `git merge nameOfYourBranch`, or simply make a new branch with new notes. 

Alternatively you can keep your notes in a separate file.
